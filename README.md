# PoC-CVE-2000-0649
A small tool to create a PoC for CVE-2000-0649.

## Usage
This script verifies if the server is vulnerable for CVE-2000-0649. Keep in mind to play with HTTP, HTTPS and different paths. In my experience, the disclosure is mostly happening when connecting over HTTP and using the default path '/' or '/images'.

You would need to supply the host/IP address and a port. By default the path is set to '/'. Optionally you can specify a path, starting with '/'.
    
```
$ python3 cve-2000-0649.py -host {hostname} -port {port} -path {path}
